# Insights on Wheels: Interactive Road Safety Dashboard using Excel 
### Project Overview:
This project is aimed at analyzing traffic accident data and identifying trends and insights related to casualties. The project will leverage several key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the severity and impact of traffic accidents, including the total number of casualties by accident severity, vehicle type, road type, and other factors.

### Business Case:
The business case for this project is to help transportation authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders improve traffic safety and reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents. By analyzing accident data and identifying trends and patterns, these stakeholders can implement targeted interventions to improve road safety and reduce the risk of accidents.

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data and identify key trends and insights related to casualties. By doing so, the project aims to inform policy and decision-making related to road safety, and ultimately help reduce the number of casualties caused by accidents.

## KPIs:
1. Primary KPI:
  - Total Casualties taken after the accident

2. Primary KPIs
  - Total Casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle

3. Secondary KPIs
  - Total casualties with respect to vehicle types
  - Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
  - Maximum casualties by road type
  - Distribution of total casualties by road surface
  - Relation between casualties by area/location and by day/night

## Task carried out

### 1. Getting dataset from the client (although this dataset was gotten here in Kaggle)

  Data was taken from Kaggle
  Data is available in the google drive link below:

### 2. Understanding the Business Case

  KPIs were studied with respect to the dataset, also stakeholders holders were determined

### 3. Data Cleaning

  Duplication was removed, columns and rows adjusted, spelling checks were done, and a few other things

### 4. Data Processing 
  This is more like extracting more details from the cleaned data to help with data analysis, for example, monthly and year column was added to help with analysis as the      client requested for the monthly trend in comparison to current and previous years

  Included columns

### 5. Data Analysis (using pivot tables and of course excel formulas)

  Pivot tables and pivot charts were created across different sheets with respect to achieving the KPIs. Thereafter, a Data Analysis Sheet was created housing all the pivot   tables earlier created for data analysis.

### 6. Data Visualisation (using charts to show insights)

  Data visualization was done using pivot charts,

### 7. Creation of a dynamic and interactive dashboard

  The dashboard became interactive and dynamic by creating a filter panel using a timeline and slicer as already created in the pivot table. The dashboard also has link       which leads to the dashboard, my email, this GitHub repository, and the Data Analysis Sheet directly and vice versa
